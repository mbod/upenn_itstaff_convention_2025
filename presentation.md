## <span style="background-color: #ffffed; color: #101010">Chat</span>GPT 

#### 1. Communication Perspective

* **Chat** = Conversation?
  1. LLM 'chat' very unlike human conversation
  2.  Better understood as individual *request-response* cycles

#### 2. IT Perspective

* **GPT** = Monolithic blackbox model?
  1. LLMs are parts of larger, complex **IT SYSTEMS**
  2. *Interconnected components* in *multiple stages*

### Intro: Who We Are and Why This Matters
#### Annenberg = A school of communication‚Äîbut what does that mean?
* We‚Äôre a social science institution focused on human communication and its effects.
* Our research spans media, public health messaging, political communication, digital technologies, and more.
#### Why GenAI? Because LLMs are communicators.
* We study communication‚Äîso we‚Äôre naturally interested in a tool that generates language, narratives, and influence.
* LLMs don‚Äôt just produce text; they participate in meaning-making.

### How ASC Is Engaging with GenAI
#### Practical Applications
- Faculty, staff, and students use LLMs in everyday workflows:
  - Drafting emails, articles, proposals.
  - Summarizing complex or large bodies of text.
  - Brainstorming ideas and outlining arguments.
- Students use them as study aids, writing coaches, and creative partners.
- Recreational use is also a reality

---

### Institutional Support
- IT facilitates access to tools like OpenAI, Claude, and Microsoft Copilot, and helps match tools to use cases.
- We support understanding around governance and data stewardship:
  - Example: The Dean‚Äôs Office, working with sensitive university
    data, uses Penn-licensed Copilot/ChatGPT accounts for compliance
    and privacy.
  - In contrast, undergrad instructors using GenAI in a classroom
    experiment use controlled environments with API access for
    transparency and acceptable-use boundaries.
- We offer workshops and consultations to emphasize ethical, critical use.


---

### Our Distinctive Lens as a Communications School
#### LLMs as Agents in the Communication Ecosystem
- We don‚Äôt just treat LLMs as productivity tools‚Äîthey‚Äôre now actors in the broader discourse.
- They can frame, reframe, persuade, obfuscate, and manipulate.
#### Key Questions We Ask:
- What makes an LLM-generated message persuasive?
- How do audiences interpret AI-authored content?
- Can these tools reinforce bias, or spread misinformation?
- How do we teach students and the public to recognize and critically engage with AI-generated communication?

### Example conversation between two humans

<pre>

Matt:    Hey Rich!
Rich:    Hey!

Matt:        [Excellent!]  What time works for you?
Rich:    Umm pretty much anytime
Matt:          [I have meetings after] 4pm but anytime before
Rich:    How about 1pm?
Matt:    Sounds great!

### Mediated conversation (Teams)

### LLM Chat is not really *conversation*


* cycles of request - response 


---

### Multiple users of a single LLM?

### IT's Role at Annenberg
#### Enabling Experimentation While Managing Risk
- We provide the infrastructure, training, and advisory support to encourage exploration while staying grounded in institutional policies.
- We evaluate tools carefully before recommending broad use.
#### Promoting Digital Literacy and Responsible Use
- Our goal is not just technical enablement, but critical engagement.
- We frame GenAI use in terms of privacy, ethics, and communicative impact.
- IT partners with researchers to support inquiry‚Äînot just implementation.


---

## Closing Perspective
- At ASC, we don‚Äôt see generative AI as just another tech trend‚Äîwe see it as a communication phenomenon.
- Our job is to understand how it shapes thinking, behavior, and public discourse.
- We‚Äôre committed to staying ahead of the curve‚Äînot just in adopting tools, but in understanding their effects on people and society.
